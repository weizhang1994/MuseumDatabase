Their eeriness cuts across styles, genres and even mediums  these are images made to look like something else: silkscreened photographic prints that have been built up layer-by-layer to look like paintings, using formats that resemble old daguerreotypes and lantern slides.

Her high-heeled feet represent a possible endpoint for the idea of the malleable and fashionable body, aimed at the true fashion victim. For those who prefer comfortable shoes, this sci-fi melding of skin and stiletto is more mutilation that enhancement.

While appearing to accidentally interact with its surroundings, the work is in fact highly choreographed. Geometric patterns migrate around the walls in an abstracted dance of light and dark, accompanied by a barely audible soundtrack. Reflecting the artists interest in visible and invisible forces, these light abstractions are also reminiscent of the light from an empty slide projector and the white screen of early cinema.

Within a short period of time she developed a distinctive old Tiwi style that brings the refined dotting of the wooden painting comb (kayimwagakimi and also pwoja) into her expressionistic mesh-like compositions. Working primarily in ochre on large-scale canvases, Tipuamantumirris ostensibly flat surfaces suggest a three-dimensional space and a rich tactile quality which translates seamlessly to the screenprinting medium.

The painting has been described as an image of narcotised elation or entrapment; an image perhaps of pure fantasy and ecstatic surrender; an image of an individual drowned by subconscious forces; or an image of exceptional wonder, translucency and transforming lyricism
WhiTau	7	Tautology 1,2,3 (after Morandi) Tautological receptacals (after Morandi)	Sculpture	Other	Emma White	20070909	20090117	300	There are four components to the work: a small, delicate still-life sculpture of bottles made fromFIMO(a synthetic polymer clay). Alongside this are two large still-life images of these and related sculptural forms. Then there is a fourth image blown up well beyond the intimate tactile scale of the original sculptural subject. White is interested in how we perceive reality, in whether we give emphasis to image over material form, and to large images over small.
WhiUnt	8	Untitled (useless, powerful) I	Sculpture	Greyscale	Emma White	20081019	20090117	480	Emma Whites small scale sculptures reward close attention. The three components in Untitled (useless, powerful) I are displayed in specific locations within a gallery space. The powerpoint and light switch are installed on the wall where they would be expected to be as functioning objects. The powerboard is unplugged, as though temporarily not required. Initially, the viewers attention glances over what appear to be everyday utilitarian objects while looking for more important or meaningful material. However, the replicas have soft edges and irregular surfaces and colouring rather than the hard-edged perfection of mass-production. On realising that they are meticulously handcrafted replicas on a one-to-one scale, there is a shock of recognition that has been likened to thrilling moments of revelation É of epiphany[i].
WilCru	11	Crutch Dance	Other	Colourful	Justene Williams	20110712	20111225	200	Crutch Danceis part of a cycle of work by Justene Williams that pushes lens-based imagery into painterly, performance and sculptural realms. This work relates closely to a group of moving-image works in which Williams creates overwhelming environments constructed from detritus, photographs and suburban props. In the case ofCrutch Dance, Williams has used a salvaged treadmill. The bizarre environments that the artist makes become the stage for increasingly odd actions built around repetitive, collaged movements  running, dancing, ducking and weaving like a punch-drunk three-dimensional painting. Here, a futurist figure vainly does battle with the treadmill, jerking with movement akin to a futurist or cubist dance and invoking Umberto Boccionis famous sculptureUnique Forms of Continuity in Space(1913).
WloAro	13	A Room Without a View	Other	Black and White	Gosia Wlodarczak	20130918	20160419	870	The nine panels ofA Room Without a Viewdocument a drawing performance by Gosia Wlodarczak. The panels originally formed the walls and ceiling of a windowless box in which Wlodarczak isolated herself for 17 days. Using a white pen, she drew on the black walls continuously between the hours of 10.30am and 5pm, drawing only what she could see within the cube. Tracing and re-tracing the visible, she drew the parts of her body in her purview, the lines of the empty room and the lines and shapes she had already drawn. As time elapsed, the drawing expanded organically across the walls, ceiling and floor, enveloping Wlodarczak in a drawn reality of her own making. Audiences were able to view the work as it progressed via a live webcam stream.

Using pattern to create dynamically shifting spaces, her work also records the performative aspect of fashion and its inherent associations with collective identity and camouflage.Combat Dragis shot in a low-tech self-filmed documentary style, and categorised, by Wyman, as a work within the field of philosophical anthropology (philosophical inquiry into human nature or the human condition).
YanDis	981	Distances	Photograph	Greyscale	William Yang	19810617	19990116	110	William Yang is a photographer, performance artist and writer and has been practicing since the late 1960s. His first solo exhibition in 1977, Sydneyphiles, was a frank depiction of the Sydney party scene and the emerging gay community. Yang then began to explore his Chinese heritage, and his photographic themes expanded to include landscapes, and the Chinese in Australia. Yang began performing his monologues with slide projection in the theatre in 1989, integrating his skills as a writer and a visual artist.

The music was loud so I leant over to shout my opening line. He pointed to his ears and shook his head and I understood that he was deaf. He wrote words on the palm of his hand. J.O.E. Joe! It was totally vivid. Ill never forget it. He brought me a drink. We didnt have small talk so things developed really fast. I made the shape of a house with my hands: the walls, a hip roof and I pointed to myself. Did he want to come home with me? He agreed.
YanThe	976	The morning after	Photograph	Greyscale	William Yang	19760817	19990116	140	Morning sun raking through a window gently lights William Yangs photograph of sleeping bodies and cast-off clothing, portraying the morning after with the intimacy of the dawn. Yang photographed Sydneys social scene of the 1970s and 80s, capturing wild times at discos, nightclubs and parties. Yang also captured the revellers at rest, photographing the supine forms of his naked lovers, night-clubbers passed out on city pavements and benches, and friends sharing makeshift beds on lounge-room floors.
YatBra	6	Brain Scapes	Sculpture	Black and White	Simon Yates	20061219	20090219	580	This installation forms part of an ongoing endeavour by Simon Yates to externalise the contents of his mind  thoughts, feelings and memories  as they take place in the same moment. The result isBrain Scapes, an abstracted, sculptural self-portrait in the form of ten star-like shapes suspended between ceiling and floor. Touching point to point, they resemble simplified neurons: the electrical transmitters of the brain that form the neural network and allow the brain to process information. Deliberately low-tech,Brain Scapesis constructed from everyday materials like wire, sticky tape, newspaper, black-and-white and colour photocopies, and matt black paint.
