The painting has been described as an image of narcotised elation or entrapment; an image perhaps of pure fantasy and ecstatic surrender; an image of an individual drowned by subconscious forces; or an image of exceptional wonder, translucency and transforming lyricism	\N	Drawing	\N	Colourful	\N	\N
WhiTau	7	MCA	Tautology 1,2,3 (after Morandi) Tautological receptacals (after Morandi)	Emma White	2007-09-09	2009-01-17	There are four components to the work: a small, delicate still-life sculpture of bottles made fromFIMO(a synthetic polymer clay). Alongside this are two large still-life images of these and related sculptural forms. Then there is a fourth image blown up well beyond the intimate tactile scale of the original sculptural subject. White is interested in how we perceive reality, in whether we give emphasis to image over material form, and to large images over small.	\N	Sculpture	\N	Other	\N	\N
WhiUnt	8	MCA	Untitled (useless, powerful) I	Emma White	2008-10-19	2009-01-17	Emma Whites small scale sculptures reward close attention. The three components in Untitled (useless, powerful) I are displayed in specific locations within a gallery space. The powerpoint and light switch are installed on the wall where they would be expected to be as functioning objects. The powerboard is unplugged, as though temporarily not required. Initially, the viewers attention glances over what appear to be everyday utilitarian objects while looking for more important or meaningful material. However, the replicas have soft edges and irregular surfaces and colouring rather than the hard-edged perfection of mass-production. On realising that they are meticulously handcrafted replicas on a one-to-one scale, there is a shock of recognition that has been likened to thrilling moments of revelation É of epiphany[i].	\N	Sculpture	\N	Greyscale	\N	\N
WilCru	11	MCA	Crutch Dance	Justene Williams	2011-07-12	2011-12-25	Crutch Danceis part of a cycle of work by Justene Williams that pushes lens-based imagery into painterly, performance and sculptural realms. This work relates closely to a group of moving-image works in which Williams creates overwhelming environments constructed from detritus, photographs and suburban props. In the case ofCrutch Dance, Williams has used a salvaged treadmill. The bizarre environments that the artist makes become the stage for increasingly odd actions built around repetitive, collaged movements  running, dancing, ducking and weaving like a punch-drunk three-dimensional painting. Here, a futurist figure vainly does battle with the treadmill, jerking with movement akin to a futurist or cubist dance and invoking Umberto Boccionis famous sculptureUnique Forms of Continuity in Space(1913).	\N	Other	\N	Colourful	\N	\N
WloAro	13	MCA	A Room Without a View	Gosia Wlodarczak	2013-09-18	2016-04-19	The nine panels ofA Room Without a Viewdocument a drawing performance by Gosia Wlodarczak. The panels originally formed the walls and ceiling of a windowless box in which Wlodarczak isolated herself for 17 days. Using a white pen, she drew on the black walls continuously between the hours of 10.30am and 5pm, drawing only what she could see within the cube. Tracing and re-tracing the visible, she drew the parts of her body in her purview, the lines of the empty room and the lines and shapes she had already drawn. As time elapsed, the drawing expanded organically across the walls, ceiling and floor, enveloping Wlodarczak in a drawn reality of her own making. Audiences were able to view the work as it progressed via a live webcam stream.	\N	Other	\N	Black and White	\N	\N

YanDis	981	MCA	Distances	William Yang	1981-06-17	1999-01-16	William Yang is a photographer, performance artist and writer and has been practicing since the late 1960s. His first solo exhibition in 1977, Sydneyphiles, was a frank depiction of the Sydney party scene and the emerging gay community. Yang then began to explore his Chinese heritage, and his photographic themes expanded to include landscapes, and the Chinese in Australia. Yang began performing his monologues with slide projection in the theatre in 1989, integrating his skills as a writer and a visual artist. These slide shows were recognised as a unique form of performance theatre and have since become his preferred way of showing his work. Yang has toured Australia and the world with shows such asSadness,Friends of Dorothy,The North,Blood LinksandShadows.	\N	Photograph	\N	Greyscale	\N	\N

Yang photographed Sydneys social scene of the 1970s and 80s, capturing wild times at discos, nightclubs and parties.

The result isBrain Scapes, an abstracted, sculptural self-portrait in the form of ten star-like shapes suspended between ceiling and floor. Touching point to point, they resemble simplified neurons: the electrical transmitters of the brain that form the neural network and allow the brain to process information.
